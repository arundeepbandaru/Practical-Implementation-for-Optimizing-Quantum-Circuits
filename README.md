# Practical-Implementation-for-Optimizing-Quantum-Circuits

Overview

The Python script provided interprets and converts an IBM OpenQASM code, which is a textual representation of a quantum circuit, into an algebraic expression. This script processes the specified quantum gates on qubits with the possibility of control-target relationships, thereby building and simplifying the corresponding algebraic expression by applying circuit identities representing the operations applied to the qubits over the sequence of gates.
